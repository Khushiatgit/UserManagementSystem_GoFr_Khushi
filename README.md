 **Overview** ðŸ‘¥

The User Management System (UMS) is a simple RESTful API implemented in Gofr, designed for managing user-related operations. This project provides basic functionality to create, retrieve, update, and delete user records in a MongoDB database. The system exposes endpoints to interact with user data, making it a foundational component for applications requiring user management capabilities.
