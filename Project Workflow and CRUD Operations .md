**User Management System** ðŸ‘¥ is a project made to efficiently manage users in a system, in a workplace, a social media app or users of a particular service.
It is created using **GoFR** ðŸš€ and have used **MongoDB** cluster for storing of the data and user details.

To keep it simple, a user model has following properties.

**Lets go through the following Postman Collection to dive deep into the functionalities** ðŸŽ¯

Now making use of the **CreateUserEndpoint** using HTTP **Post** Method, lets create 5 users in the system. 

**USER 1**

**USER 2**
<img width="1057" alt="Added User 2" src="https://github.com/Khushiatgit/UserManagementSystem_GoFR_Khushi/assets/83766368/c10264af-840d-47ea-b40e-530d31ce78ed">
**USER 3**
<img width="1057" alt="Added User 3" src="https://github.com/Khushiatgit/UserManagementSystem_GoFR_Khushi/assets/83766368/8ee0f1b9-2e1d-40eb-af4a-8e6e6b6f7830">
**USER 4**
<img width="1057" alt="Added User 4" src="https://github.com/Khushiatgit/UserManagementSystem_GoFR_Khushi/assets/83766368/33243677-0f94-4cbb-80ef-f671b0517e0b">
**USER 5**
<img width="1057" alt="Added User 5" src="https://github.com/Khushiatgit/UserManagementSystem_GoFR_Khushi/assets/83766368/1ad3f275-b651-44fa-ac58-b98fe8ed09ea">

Using the **GetUserEndpoint**, we'll fetch the details of all users present in the system using HTTP **Get** Method

<img width="1057" alt="Get ALL users" src="https://github.com/Khushiatgit/UserManagementSystem_GoFR_Khushi/assets/83766368/82f87ff8-1af6-44ba-a59e-67cd7ba6b841">

Let us update the details of USER 2 and USER 5 with details of updation sent in the request body to **UpdateUserEndpoint** using HTTP **Put** request,

the **details have been updated**, let us check using GET request,

Now, finally let us make use of **DeleteUserendpoint** to **delete User 4** from the system, using DElete method.

<img width="1057" alt="Delete User 4" src="https://github.com/Khushiatgit/UserManagementSystem_GoFR_Khushi/assets/83766368/d8da429d-bda8-478f-b4a0-f29b8c9b14c9">

Check using GET if the **user 4 has been deleted  ?**

We are almost done through the Project Workflow, finally we can see if the data is being correctly stored in the MongoDB collection, users :
